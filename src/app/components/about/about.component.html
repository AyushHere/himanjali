          I guide people back to themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          With roots in Ayurveda, yoga psychology, and energy healing, I help growthoriented individuals uncover why they feel stuck — emotionally, mentally, or
          energetically — and empower them to move forward from a place of clarity and
          self-trust.

          My journey into healing began not in textbooks, but in my own body. I’ve battled
          severe PTSD and anxiety, and it was through deep inner work, swadhyay,
          movement, somatic awareness, and spiritual practices that I found my way back to
          myself. That’s why I don’t believe in a one-size-fits-all method — because real
          healing is as unique as the person seeking it.

          My background in science (BSc Biotech + MSc in Ayurveda Biology) gave me
          structure. But it was self-inquiry, lived experience, and an integration of multiple
          healing modalities that brought true transformation. My life actually changed when
          i started healing myself under yoga psychologist ilashrei anand and she
          introduced me to yogic wisdom.

          Today, I hold space for others walking their own paths — blending ancient
          wisdom, intuitive coaching, and energy work to support holistic, lasting growth.
          You already hold the answers.
          I simply help you remember.
