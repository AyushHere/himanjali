        <p class="mb-4">
          I’m a guide, space-holder, and intuitive facilitator of healing.
          Rooted in the wisdom of Ayurveda and Integral Chakra Psychology, I
          support growth-oriented individuals in reconnecting with their inner
          truth. As a health coach, I help people identify and release limiting
          belief patterns, and cultivate healthier, more empowering belief
          systems. My approach is grounded in radical self-acceptance. When
          people feel emotionally, mentally, or energetically stuck, I gently
          guide them to uncover the deeper roots beneath the surface. Whether
          it’s a blocked pattern, unprocessed emotion, or a disconnection from
          intuition, we work together to create space for clarity, alignment,
          and empowered forward movement
